# Dynare Syntax

This VS Code extension enables syntax highlighting for Dynare files.
MATLAB code within Dynare files is also highlighted.

You can install this extension via the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shsu.dynare-syntax).

The [syntaxes/dynare.tmLanguage.json](syntaxes/dynare.tmLanguage.json) file
    was generated using Perplexity with Claude 3.5.
Ongoing improvements are being made with the assistance of Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

**NOTE**: This extension is still under development.
If you encounter any bugs, please create an [issue](https://github.com/shihhsuanhsu/vscode-dynare-syntax/issues).
