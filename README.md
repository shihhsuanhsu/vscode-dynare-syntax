# Syntax Highlighting for Dynare

This VS Code extension enables syntax highlighting for Dynare files.
Matlab code in the Dynare files is also highlighted.
The [syntaxes/dynare.tmLanguage.json](syntaxes/dynare.tmLanguage.json) file
was generated using Perplexity with Claude 3.5.
Ongoing improvements are made with the assistance of Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

**NOTE**: This extension is still under development.
